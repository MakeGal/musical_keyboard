# Arduino Musical Keyboard

A simple interactive musical keyboard built with an ESP32-C3 microcontroller. Press buttons to play different songs through the DFPlayer Mini MP3 module.

## Features

- 7 buttons to trigger different audio tracks
- Press the same button again to pause playback
- Simple and intuitive interface
- Volume control through code

## Hardware Components

- ESP32-C3 microcontroller
- DFRobotDFPlayerMini MP3 player
- 7 pushbuttons
- Speaker (connected to DFPlayer Mini)
- SD card with MP3 files (numbered 001.mp3 to 007.mp3)

## Setup

1. Connect the buttons to the GPIOs specified in the code (5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 20, 21)
2. Connect the DFPlayer Mini to the ESP32 using Serial1 (RX=1, TX=0)
3. Prepare an SD card with numbered MP3 files (001.mp3 to 007.mp3)
4. Insert the SD card into the DFPlayer Mini
5. Upload the code to the ESP32-C3

## Development

This project uses PlatformIO for development. To modify or enhance:

1. Open the project in PlatformIO
2. Modify the `src/main.cpp` file
3. Adjust button pins or functionality as needed
